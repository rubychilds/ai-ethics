## [A Guide to Writing the NeurIPS Impact Statement](https://medium.com/@operations_18894/a-guide-to-writing-the-neurips-impact-statement-4293b723f832)

We evaluated a [guide](https://medium.com/@operations_18894/a-guide-to-writing-the-neurips-impact-statement-4293b723f832) produced by the NeurIPS conference for writing the ethical impact statement required for submission for the conference.

### Overall evaluation

### Description of the tool

_What is its purpose?_ 
- conversation starter, prompting people who would not otherwise have thought about societal impacts to think about that and providing them with questions to ask

_Who is the intended user?_ 
- computer science academic researchers

_What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)?_
- impacts of research outputs

### Best for:

_What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?_

- entry-level ethical thought
- crafting an impact statement for NeurIPS
- starting a piece of work that will lead to a NeurIPS paper

### Pros & cons

_What are the benefits of this tool?_

- accessible to computer scientists (and everyone else) who has not thought about ethics/implications before
- the ‘impact stack’ is a useful research structure

_What are the challenges in using this tool?_

- could be turned into something that is clearer

### Limitations, especially any technical issues

_E.g. difficult to integrate or customize_

- needs to be made clearer for practical use

- gap - no actual assessment of risk

- a set of ideas, not a structured usable checklist
