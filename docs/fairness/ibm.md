**Description of the tool**

A repository of 9 different debiasing algorithms covering pre,. during, and post modelling phases. Not only a python package but also an interactive demonstration that provides an introduction to fairness concepts in AI, as well as examples of 3 different datasets.

Pre-Processing:

- Reweighing: Weights the examples in each (group, label) combination differently to ensure fairness before classification.

- Optimised Preprocessing: Learns a probabilistic transformation that can modify the features and the labels in the training data.
  In-Processing:

- Adversarial Debiasing: Learns a classifier that maximizes prediction accuracy and simultaneously reduces an adversary's ability to determine the protected attribute from the predictions. This approach leads to a fair classifier as the predictions cannot carry any group discrimination information that the adversary can exploit.
  Post-Processing:

- Reject Option Based Classification: Changes predictions from a classifier to make them fairer. Provides favorable outcomes to unprivileged groups and unfavorable outcomes to privileged groups in a confidence band around the decision boundary with the highest uncertainty.

**Best for: **

Data Scientists + Model builders looking for quick and easy ways to “de-bias” their system, at all stages of the pipeline.

**Pros & cons**

Pros:

1. Fairly comprehensive selection of tutorial notebooks to learn from:[ https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/tree/master/examples)

2. Can Integrate easily in sklearn[ https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/blob/master/examples/sklearn/demo_new_features.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/blob/master/examples/sklearn/demo_new_features.ipynb)

3. Well defined API with lots of functionality.

**Limitations, especially any technical issues**

There is a general consensus that “De-Bias”ing algorithms do not actually lead to fairer systems in general, so whilst this package is a good starting point to thinking about how a dataset can be altered, or a model’s behavior changed with fairness in mind it might not be that effective in practice.

The tool is not very effective at identifying who might be being treated unfairly within a system and where that bias might be originating from.

Perhaps a steep learning curve in terms of integrating into an existing model building pipeline
