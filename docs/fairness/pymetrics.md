## Description of the tool

What is its purpose?

_Measure the effects of discriminatory patterns in training data and the predictions_

Who is the intended user?

_Data Scientist evaluating socially sensitive decision processes in ML_

What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)?

_Measure disparate impact in data and predictions_

**Best for: **

What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?

This tool is great at looking at one form of fairness: disparate impact. This concept is often used in the law for standards of selection procedures. If an algorithm leads to a disparity between protected groups (gender, race, age 40+), then it may not be used as part of the selection procedure.

However, we know that there are several definitions of fairness that are more appropriate for cases as credit modelling.

I’d only use this tool if my only goal is to measure disparate impact.

## Pros & cons

What are the benefits of this tool?

- Very easy to install and follow the instructions on its examples

- Includes adverse impact over time

What are the challenges in using this tool?

- This tool includes only one form of fairness. That is if groups are different according to a standard of statistical significance (e.g.: 4/5th, fisher, z-test, bayes factor, chi squared)

- It does not include more bias metrics as Equalised Odds that may be more appropriate for many classification models

- Examples do not explain how to interpret the results in the context of bias. Whoever uses the tool could not draw relevant conclusions from the examples.\_

- Assumes you’re very familiar with all statistical test, some extra information on them would have been useful

## Limitations, especially any technical issues

Limited to only one form of fairness definition
