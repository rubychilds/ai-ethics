# Open-source toolkit gaps

## Fairness

- Tools assume and require a high level of expertise in both fairness literature and data science / statistics
- No guidance on which mitigation techniques should be used and when
- No comprehensive case studies applied to a context, examples are high-level
- Visualizations generally difficult to understand for non-technical users
- Focus on classification, very little on regression
- Focus on group fairness, limited individual fairness

## Explanation

- Technical in nature so for a technical audience - commercialization leads to user interfaces and ease in use. OS needs to know technicalities in order to add value and use
- Explainability goes beyond explaining to a tech audience. It is often needed for business and product owners. Hence accessibility is key.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- NLP focused package or library with decent documentation around detecting and removing bias that is model agnostic
